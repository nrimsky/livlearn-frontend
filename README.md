This was the frontend of the livlearn web app which I built to streamline the collecting, sharing and curating of online learning content, including books, videos, blogs, courses and podcasts. It is based on React / Typescript and calls the livlearn api as well as uses Firebase for authentication and as a database for some things. The livlearn web app is no longer deployed anywhere. I may redeploy it if there is significant interest from anyone.
